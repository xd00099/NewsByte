       "full_text": "Aaron Rodgers took the classy way out after his long-awaited trade to the New York Jets went through Monday. The now-former Green Bay Packers quarterback posted a lengthy farewell letter to Instagram on Tuesday, thanking the Packers organization and fan base after 18 years, along with photos documenting his journey from draft pick to four-time MVP. He ended the message by saying he will see Green Bay again and will always feel a connection to the city: \"This is not the end for us, I will see you again Green Bay, you\u2019ll always have my heart.\"      View this post on Instagram       A post shared by Aaron Rodgers (@aaronrodgers12) Rodgers mentioned 40 different people by name in the farewell, including former general manager Ted Thompson, former head coach Mike McCarthy, current head coach Matt LaFleur and several members of the coaching staff, training staff and PR team. As Rodgers has done in the past, many are referred to by nicknames. The 39-year-old quarterback even shouted out current Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst, a man he has been rumored to have feuded with in recent years. No current or former Packers players are mentioned by name, with Rodgers instead thanking them all. One of Rodgers' best friends on the Packers, left tackle David Bakhtiari, posted his own goodbye hours before, complete with Nickelback musical accompaniment. Rodgers' goodbye is a nice gesture given how tenuous his time in Green Bay was in his later years and how protracted his exit became. After multiple offseasons of retirement and trade speculation (including an actual trade demand in 2021), Rodgers announced March 15 that he planned to play for the Jets next season. It took more than a month for the Packers and Jets to actually reach a deal. The end result is Rodgers heading to New York in exchange for a swap of first-round picks, a second-round pick and a sixth-round pick in 2023, plus another second-round pick in 2024 that becomes a first-rounder if Rodgers players 65% of the Jets' offensive snaps next season. The Jets also receive a fifth-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, which begins Thursday. Rodgers joins a Jets team with enormous expectations. The franchise went 7-10 last season and looked competent at times despite ranking last in the NFL in passer rating, and it's now adding the second-most efficient quarterback in NFL history by that same metric. Thank you. \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible to fully express the gratitude that I have to the @packers , our incredible fans, the state of Wisconsin, the thousands of players that I crossed paths with, the incredible men and women who work for the organization, and the amazing people who I got to meet along the way, in one post with 10 pictures, but I hope you read this and feel my heart and soul, filled with love, joy, and peace about my time in green and gold. \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b I grew up in Green Bay, drafted at 21, fell in love with the game, met some lifelong friends, and take with me memories that will last a lifetime. I\u2019m grateful to the late Ted Thompson for drafting me, for my head coaches, especially the 13 years with Mike McCarthy, and the last 4 with Matt LaFleur. I had some incredible men to work with in the QB room over the years including Tom, AVP, Luke, and Connor. Huge thank you to my guys in the equipment room, Red, TBone, Odea, Kev, Bryan, Andy Grouber, All my dear friends in the training room over the years, Nate, Flea, Doc McKenzie, Doc Gray, Pepp, and Cuz. The legendary Adam Korzun and his incredible staff; Dougie, Crabby, and Scotty, for always looking out for me; Tom, Nate, Sarah, and Jason in PR, Evan for bringing my work life to film, The Rock and Wayne, for giving words to the highlights of my career, Grey, and Big Rob for your work with our guys over the years, Bloke, Thad, Grant and Gizz in the weight room, Bob Harlan, Russ Ball, Mark Murphy and Brian Gutekunst for your stewardship of the organization, every one on the 3rd and 4th floors who make that building run smoothly, and so many countless others at the loading dock, tours, concessions, maintenance, our field crew, etc. To the fans, THANK YOU, you made every run out of the tunnel special, every home game magical, and it was my honor to be your QB. To my teammates, I love you all, and am thankful for the moments on and off the field that brought us close. I played with legends, I played with friends; thanks for believing in me and having my back always \u2764\ufe0f This is not the end for us, I will see you again Green Bay, you\u2019ll always have my heart \u2764\ufe0f -12 #grateful #18years #\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b Rodgers shouted out his once and future offensive coordinator multiple times, and a new AFC East rival detailed to Yahoo Sports the impact Rodgers could have. Fantasy football analyst Matt Harmon breaks down the long-awaited Aaron Rodgers trade. The Jets will be popular among bettors this season. Charles McDonald, Jori Epstein and Frank Schwab give their instant reactions to news that the Green Bay Packers have traded four-time MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers to the New York Jets. Everyone likes the trade a lot for the Packers, and hopes Rodgers can take advantage of a loaded Jets roster to perform in year one. The trio also give their thoughts on the recent gambling suspensions given out to five players, including Detroit Lions first-round pick WR Jameson Williams. While the NFL's punishment for players gambling has seemed harsh, it's clear they're making sure they nip it in the bud as sports gambling becomes more popular. Later in the show, the group dive into fixing every AFC team one at a time. The hosts take turns giving one major move each team could make that would improve their odds at contending for a Super Bowl. It's hard to blame the Bears for being glad to see Rodgers go. Wilson\u2019s reclamation could be a part of the broader view of this trade. It's a scenario where Wilson could learn from a player who \u2014 if an understudy can keep up \u2014 has plenty to offer. Don't worry, Jets fans, Aaron Rodgers is still in the team's plans for 2023. Charles Robinson and Charles McDonald take a way-too-early look at the 2023 NFL season by giving their dark horse predictions for AFC and NFC champions, MVP, rushing and receiving leaders and coach of the year. The founder of the cognition testing company has since said reports of the potential top 5 pick's results are \"not true.\" Fantasy football analyst Matt Harmon delivers a special NFL draft edition of his Care/Don't Care column! \"Don't believe everything you read on the internet.\" Dalton Del Don debuts a new fantasy baseball series in which he attempts to point out stats we shouldn't necessarily believe. The Chiefs and many of their fans are steadfast. One protester says she is frequently outside of Arrowhead Stadium before games, often verbally abused by passersby and told to \"go home.\" Jim Boeheim was cleared of all wrongdoing in a fatal 2019 crash that killed Jorge Jimenez. Here's how to watch the NFL Draft in 2023 on ABC, ESPN, ESPN Deportes and NFL Network for free and streaming TV like Fubo, Sling, YouTube, Hulu and more. The new CBA will officially kick in July 1. \u201cI either have to pay to play golf or pay for a place to live.\u201d East Coast basketball fans rejoice. Fantasy baseball analyst Fred Zinkie highlights how to maneuver a trade with every player archetype. Seven years after he went No. 1 overall, Jared Goff may be once again watching the NFL Draft and wondering what his future holds."

       "full_text": "\n      The ISIS-K leader who planned the deadly 2021 suicide bombing at the Kabul international airport\u2019s Abbey Gate was killed by the Taliban, according to the National Security Council.\n   \n      The administration didn\u2019t name the ISIS-K leader, but John Kirby, the National Security Council\u2019s coordinator for strategic communications, called him \u201cthe mastermind of the horrific attack,\u201d which was carried out in the final days of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Kirby did not specify when the Taliban killed the ISIS-K leader, but called it one in a \u201cseries of high-profile leadership losses\u201d that ISIS-K has suffered this year.\n   \n      The terrorist who carried out the suicide bombing, Abdul Rehman Al-Loghri, had been released from prison only days earlier when the Taliban took control of the area. The attack left 13 US service members and more than 170 Afghans dead.\n   \n      ISIS-K stands for ISIS-Khorasan, the terror organization\u2019s affiliate that is active in Afghanistan and the surrounding region. Since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban has tried to crackdown on ISIS-K throughout the country, but has not succeeded in destroying the terror organization.\n   \n      That the US announced the terror leader had been killed by the Taliban, a group it fought a nearly two decade long war against, rather than by American forces points to the limits of the US\u2019 ability to carry out operations in Afghanistan following the withdrawal.\n   \n      Last month, Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command, told US lawmakers that \u201cin Afghanistan, the reduction in collection, analytical resources, and Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance assets means our campaign against Al Qaeda and ISIS Khorasan is challenged; while we can see the broad contours of attack planning, we lack the granularity to see the complete threat picture.\u201d\n   \n      The terror group, he said, had increased its attacks in the region and was trying to plan attacks outside of Afghanistan against the US homeland and American interests abroad.\n   \n      Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, praised the killing of the ISIS-K leader while arguing that the Biden administration remains responsible for the failures that led to the attack at Abbey Gate.\n   \n      \u201cAny time a terrorist is taken off the board is a good day. But this doesn\u2019t diminish the Biden administration\u2019s culpability for the failures that led to the attack at Abbey Gate, and will in no way deter the committee\u2019s investigation,\u201d said McCaul in a statement. \n   \n      The father of Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, who was killed in the bombing, told CNN that he was notified by the military Tuesday morning.\n   \n      \u201cIt\u2019s great, we have another terrorist off the face of this earth. I\u2019m good with that,\u201d said Darin Hoover. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t absolve the administration or the State Department or the Pentagon from taking responsibility or accountability for what happened. They haven\u2019t stepped up and said we messed this up and it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n   \n      \u201cAnd I personally think it can happen again,\u201d he added.\n   \n      Republicans on Capitol Hill have vowed to hold the Biden administration responsible for the withdrawal from Afghanistan, with some GOP members calling it a \u201cbotched\u201d operation and a failure in multiple congressional hearings.\n   \n      At a House Oversight Committee hearing last week, Michigan Republican Rep. Lisa McClain said the Biden administration had \u201cwholeheartedly defended this atrocity in Afghanistan.\u201d\n   \n      Meanwhile, the administration and its allies have repeatedly argued that President Joe Biden was forced to withdraw from Afghanistan because of an agreement signed between former President Donald Trump and the Taliban months earlier, tying the White House\u2019s hands.\n   \n      Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said it was \u201cmorally confused and politically cynical\u201d to only blame the Biden administration, since mistakes made over 20 years of war and presidents of both parties led to the final outcome of America\u2019s longest war.\n   \nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network.

       "full_text": "\n      The World Health Organization warned Tuesday of a \u201chuge biological risk\u201d after Sudanese fighters seized the National Public Health Laboratory in the capital Khartoum, as foreign nations raced to mount rapid evacuation efforts from the country and violence punctured a fragile US-brokered ceasefire. \n   \n      Gunfire and the roar of fighter jets was heard by CNN journalists in Khartoum on Tuesday, half a day after the announcement of a 72-hour truce raised hopes of opening up escape routes for civilians desperate to flee. Heavy clashes erupted between the Sudanese military and the Rapid Support Forces, the paramilitary group battling the army for control of the country, in the northern part of Khartoum state, eyewitnesses told CNN. \n   \n      The two warring sides accused each other of violating the agreement. \n   \n      The number of people killed in Sudan since violence broke out eleven days ago has reached at least 459 deaths, the World Health Organization also said on Tuesday, with at least 4,072 people injured.\n   \n      A high-ranking medical source told CNN that the lab, which contains samples of diseases and other biological material, had been taken over by RSF forces. The WHO did not appoint blame for the lab seizure but said medical technicians no longer had access to the facility. \n   \n      The RSF has denied taking control of the lab, telling CNN in a statement on Wednesday it had \u201cno control over the laboratory.\u201d\n   \n      Nima Saeed Abid, the WHO representative in Sudan, described the  development as \u201cextremely dangerous because we have polio isolates in the lab, we have measles isolates in the lab, we have cholera isolates in the lab.\u201d\n   \n      \u201cThere is a huge biological risk associated with the occupation of the central public health lab in Khartoum by one of the fighting parties,\u201d he added. \n   \nRival generals are battling for control in Sudan. Here's a simple guide to the fighting \n \n      The WHO said in a statement to CNN that \u201ctrained laboratory technicians no longer have access to the laboratory\u201d and that the facility had suffered power cuts, meaning \u201cit is not possible to properly manage the biological materials that are stored in the laboratory for medical purposes.\u201d\n   \n      The power cuts also mean there is a risk of spoilage of depleting stocks of blood bags, according to the director-general of the laboratory.\n   \n      The medical source told CNN that \u201cthe danger lies in the outbreak of any armed confrontation in the laboratory because that will turn the laboratory into a germ bomb.\u201d\n   \n      \u201cAn urgent and rapid international intervention is required to restore electricity and secure the laboratory from any armed confrontation because we are facing a real biological danger,\u201d the source added.\n   \n      CNN has reached out to the RSF for comment.\n   \n      The United Kingdom, France, South Korea and a host of other countries confirmed Tuesday that they were pulling out nationals after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that a three-day ceasefire had been agreed.\n   \n      The White House is meanwhile considering a plan to send US troops to Port Sudan to help with the evacuation of American citizens, a US official with knowledge of the operations told CNN on Monday. \n \n      Three US warships are also being deployed off the coast of Sudan. A Navy official told CNN that the US is sending the USNS Brunswick to Sudan, one day after the Pentagon said the USS Truxton is already off the coast of the country and the USS Lewis B. Puller is on its way.\n   \n      CNN\u2019s team in Djibouti obtained images released by the US military showing personnel arriving in that country. France and Pakistan both said they had evacuated hundreds of nationals, while China said most of its citizens had also been pulled out of the country.\n   \n      As many as 500 people fleeing the fighting have begun boarding the French frigate \u201cLorraine\u201d in Port-Sudan on Tuesday afternoon, a spokesman for the French Chief of Defense Staff told CNN.\n   \n      At least one US citizen, Dr. Bushra Ibnauf Sulieman, a Sudanese American physician, was killed in Khartoum on Tuesday.\n   \n      Sulieman, who taught at the University of Khartoum, the oldest medical school in the country, died \u201cafter receiving fatal stab wounds in front of his house from unknown persons, according to the Preliminary Committee of Sudan Doctors\u2019 Trade Union.\n   \n      \u201cDr. Sulieman was murdered outside of his home due to the security situation in Sudan while he was escorting his father to a dialysis appointment,\u201d said Dr. Yasir Elamin, President of the Sudanese American Physicians Association.\n   \n      Previous ceasefires have collapsed within hours of being struck since clashes first gripped Sudan in mid-April. But the latest agreement, which Blinken said followed two days of \u201cintense negotiation,\u201d has raised hopes that it would open a window in which foreign nations could hurry citizens and staff to safety. According to a statement from the Sudanese Armed Forces, Saudi Arabia was also involved in mediating the truce.\n   \n      On Tuesday, both sides of the conflict accused each other of breaking the truce. The armed forces said the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) were moving military convoys to the capital in order to carry out a large scale military operation, had deployed snipers in parts of Khartoum, and were conducting operations near embassies. The army did not provide evidence for the claims. \n   \n      The RSF blamed the army for violating the truce by \u201ccontinuing to attack Khartoum by planes.\u201d Eyewitnesses told CNN that fighter jets were heard over Omdurman to the north of the capital.\n   \n      As the conflict rages on through its second week, water supplies are scarce and food is \u201crunning out\u201d in Khartoum state, a witness told CNN on Tuesday.\n   \n      \u201cShops are running out of food completely\u201d and several food factories in the state had been looted, the witness, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons, told CNN.\n   \n      \u201cAs for the water supplies, we don\u2019t have water for the eleventh day continuously. We only get water from a well nearby. So you have to go all the way to the well with barrels or stuff if you have a car or stuff. If not you have to take something small to get enough water for you,\u201d the witness said.\n   \n      Saif Mohamed Othman, 51, a freelancer who resides in Shambat, North Bahri, told CNN on Tuesday that food stocks have run out in stores, made worse by the complete burning of the central market, which supplies large parts of Bahri with vegetables, meat and other food.\n   \n      Residents are also struggling financially because state employees had not received their wages since before the Eid al-Fitr holiday at the end of last week, and the bank\u2019s ATMs have stopped functioning, Othman told CNN.\n   \n      Othman told CNN there are patrols in place to protect the neighborhood from the widespread looting and robbing that large areas in Khartoum have been exposed to due to the lack of security and police presence.\n   \n      On Monday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) warned that shortages of food, water, medicines and fuel are becoming \u201cextremely acute\u201d in Khartoum and surrounding areas. \n   \n      \u201cAccess to health care, including sexual and reproductive health care, has been critically impacted by the conflict,\u201d UNOCHA added. \u201cDisplacement of civilians continues to be reported in Khartoum, Northern, Blue Nile, North Kordofan, North Darfur, West Darfur and South Darfur states, as well as cross-border movements to surrounding countries.\u201d\n   \n      Many Sudanese people caught in the middle of the fighting have attempted to make their own perilous escapes from the capital, taking advantages of brief breaks in combat to rush to safety.\n   \n      Sudan has been racked with violence since a bloody power struggle between two rival generals spilled into the streets, with forces loyal to each man engaging in combat on the streets of Khartoum and in towns around the capital.\n   \n      Over the course of fighting, the RSF and Sudanese military have issued statements discrediting one another, with unsubstantiated claims of their control over key posts of the capital and accusations of each side targeting civilians.\n   \n      On Monday, the Sudanese military claimed that the RSF killed an Egyptian diplomat, while the RSF claimed the army targeted civilians in an airstrike on a Khartoum neighborhood. Neither group provided evidence for the claims.\n   \n  CNN\u2019s Sam Kiley, Jennifer Hansler, Donald Judd, Pierre Bairin, Aurore Laborie, Tara John and Mo Tawfeeq contributed reporting\n \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network.

The company reported first-quarter revenue of $69.8bn, up 3% year-over-year and above analyst predictions of $68.9bn. Its cloud business reported a profit for the first time since its launch, taking in $191m. Shares were up nearly 3% in after-hours trading, as investors were heartened by Alphabet\u2019s announcement of a $70bn stock buyback. In a statement accompanying the report, the company\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, acknowledged the growing momentum of its cloud services and Alphabet is continuing to invest in search capabilities, including in the use of artificial intelligence. \u201cWe introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI,\u201d he said. \u201cOur North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation.\u201d Artificial intelligence was a big focus of the day, mentioned upwards of 60 times during a call with investors accompanying the report. Pichai said the company would accelerate its development of AI, with safeguards in place. After the success of Microsoft-owned ChatGPT, Alphabet announced Bard \u2013 its own AI chatbot \u2013 in February. \u201cAs we continue to bring AI to our products, our AI principles and the highest tenets of information integrity remain at the core of all our work,\u201d Pichai said. While in previous earnings reports Alphabet fared better than some of its peers such as Meta and Twitter, it had stumbled in recent months, announcing in August it would freeze hiring. In January it cut more than 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its global workforce, and a leaked internal memo in March revealed Alphabet would be cutting back on some employee perks in an effort to save money. Tuesday\u2019s report suggests a potential recovery, even as the YouTube parent company has struggled to compete with the meteoric rise of TikTok, reporting in its previous earnings that YouTube ad revenue in quarter four of 2022 shrank for the first time in the company\u2019s history \u2013 falling about 2% to $7bn from $7.2bn year over year. YouTube ad revenue was down 2.6% in the quarter, but at $6.69bn still beat the $6.64bn expected by analysts. The company is continuing to invest in short-form video to compete with TikTok, and Pichai stated in the call on Tuesday that YouTube Shorts now has 50bn daily views, up from 30bn this time last year.

All eyes will be on ongoing earnings reports, with Meta set to release its own on Wednesday and Apple reporting on Thursday. The company stated in its report that despite layoffs, its headcount was up 16% year over year. But despite the relatively positive report, investor optimism remains \u201cmodest\u201d, said Max Willens, a senior analyst at market research firm Insider Intelligence. \u201cIts cloud segment turning a profit is notable, and a testament to management\u2019s diligence in steering Cloud toward profitability.

He added that Google\u2019s core business, advertising revenue, remains \u201cunder threat\u201d, with YouTube revenues declining again and other revenues rising less than 2%. \u201cGoogle\u2019s core business is facing the most serious challenges it has encountered in quite some time,\u201d he said."

       "full_text": " CAIRO (AP) \u2014 Sudanese and foreigners streamed out of the capital of Khartoum and other battle zones, as fighting Tuesday shook a new three-day truce brokered by the United States and Saudi Arabia. Aid agencies raised increasing alarm over the crumbling humanitarian situation in a country reliant on outside help. A series of short cease-fires the past week have either failed outright or brought only intermittent lulls in the fighting that has raged between forces loyal to the country\u2019s two top generals since April 15. The lulls have been enough for dramatic evacuations of hundreds of foreigners by air and land, which continued Tuesday. But they have brought no relief to millions of Sudanese caught in the crossfire, struggling to find food, shelter and medical care as explosions, gunfire and looters wreck their neighborhoods. In a country where a third of the population of 46 million already needed humanitarian assistance, multiple aid agencies have had to suspend operations and dozens of hospitals have been forced to shut down. The U.N. refugee agency said it was gearing up for potentially tens of thousands of people fleeing into neighboring countries. Calls for negotiations to end the crisis in Africa\u2019s third-largest nation have been ignored. For many Sudanese, the departure of diplomats, aid workers and other foreigners and the closure of embassies are terrifying signs that international powers expect the mayhem to only worsen.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the power struggle between rival generals and their military forces is not only putting Sudan\u2019s future at risk, \u201cit is lighting a fuse that could detonate across borders, causing immense suffering for years, and setting development back by decades.\u201d The U.N. chief urged the Sudanese military, commanded by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the rival Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group led by Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, \u201cto silence the guns\u201d immediately. \u2033\u201cThe conflict will not, and must not, be resolved on the battlefield,\u201d Guterres told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council late Tuesday. U.N. special envoy for Sudan Volker Perthes, who moved from Khartoum to Port Sudan with most U.N. staff and many humanitarian organizations, accused both warring parties of fighting \u201cwith disregard for the laws and norms of war,\u201d citing attacks on densely populated areas. With supply lines running out, he said, there is mounting fear of increased criminality, and \u201creports of prisoners being released from detention centers across Khartoum have compounded these fears.\u201d Thousands of Sudanese have been fleeing Khartoum and its neighboring city of Omdurman. Bus stations in the capital were packed Tuesday morning with people who had spent the night there in hopes of getting on a departing bus.  Drivers increased prices, sometimes tenfold, for routes to the border crossing with Egypt or the eastern Red Sea city of Port Sudan. Fuel prices have skyrocketed, to $67 a gallon from $4.20, and prices for food and water have doubled in many cases, the Norwegian Refugee Council said. Those lucky enough to reach the border crossings face additional hardships. Moaz al-Ser, a teacher, arrived at the Arqin border crossing with Egypt early Tuesday with his wife and three children after a harrowing trip from Omdurman. They were among hundreds of families who were waiting to be processed. Many had spent the night in an open area near the border. \u201cThe crossing point is overwhelmed and authorities on both sides don\u2019t have the capacity to handle such a growing number of arrivals,\u201d he said. Secretary-General Guterres cited reports of armed clashes across the country, with people fleeing their homes in Blue Nile and North Kordofan states and across Western Darfur as well. Terrified people remain trapped indoors with dwindling food, water, medicine and fuel, and health services near collapse, he said. Joyce Msuya, the assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said at least 20 hospitals have been forced to close due to damage, military use or lack of resources. She also told the council \u201cthere have been numerous reports of sexual and gender-based violence.\u201d The 72-hour cease-fire announced by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was to last until late Thursday night, extending a nominal three-day truce over the weekend. The rival forces said Tuesday they would observe the cease-fire. In separate announcements, they said Saudi Arabia played a role in the negotiations. But fighting continued, with explosions, gunfire and the roar of warplanes overhead around the capital region. \u201cThey stop only when they run out of ammunition,\u201d Omdurman resident Amin Ishaq said. Al-Roumy, a medical facility in Omdurman, said it suspended its services after it was hit by a shell Tuesday.  \u201cThey don\u2019t respect cease-fires,\u201d said Atiya Abdalla Atiya, a senior figure in the Sudan Doctors\u2019 Syndicate, a group that monitors casualties.  Dr. Bushra Ibnauf Sulieman, a Sudanese-American physician who headed the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Khartoum, was stabbed to death outside his home, the Doctors\u2019 Syndicate said. He had practiced medicine for many years in the United States, where his children reside, but had returned to Sudan to train doctors. Colleagues said he had been treating those wounded in the fighting in recent days and that it was not known who killed him. The World Heath Organization, meanwhile, expressed concern that one of the warring parties had seized control of the central public health laboratory in Khartoum.  \u201cThat is extremely, extremely dangerous because we have polio isolates in the lab. We have measles isolates in the lab. We have cholera isolates in the lab,\u201d Dr. Nima Saeed Abid, the WHO representative in Sudan, told a U.N. briefing in Geneva by video call from Port Sudan. He did not identify which side held the facility but said they had expelled technicians and power was cut, so it was not possible to properly manage the biological materials. \u201cThere is a huge biological risk.\u201d Clashes meanwhile escalated in the western Darfur region, residents said. Armed groups, wearing RSF uniforms, attacked several areas in Genena, a provincial capital, burning and looting properties and camps for displaced people. \u201cFierce battles are raging all over the city,\u201d said a doctor in Genena, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. \u201cAll eyes are on Khartoum but the situation here is unimaginable.\u201d Women and children were fleeing homes in the city center, and the city\u2019s main hospital has not functioned for days, with unknown numbers of dead and wounded, she said.  More fighters on motorcycles and horses have flowed into the city to join the battles, with dead bodies lying in the streets, according to Darfur 24, an online news outlet focusing on covering the war-wrecked region. The RSF has its roots in Darfur, where it emerged from the notorious Janjaweed militias that committed atrocities there while putting down a rebellion in the 2000s. At least 459 people, including civilians and fighters, have been killed, and over 4,000 wounded since fighting began, the U.N. health agency said, citing Sudan\u2019s Health Ministry. Among them were 166 deaths and over 2,300 wounded in Khartoum, it said. Secretary-General Guterres said four U.N. staff were killed. The U.N. said they were three Sudanese working for the World Food Program and one Sudanese working for the International Organization for Migration. Those who are able have made their way to the Egyptian border, Port Sudan or relatively calmer provinces along the Nile. But the full scale of displacement has been difficult to measure. Msuya said the U.N. has received reports \u201cof tens of thousands of people arriving in the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia, and South Sudan.\u201d  Mohammed Mahdi, of the International Rescue Committee, warned that resources were growing thin at the Tunaydbah refugee camp in eastern Sudan after 3,000 people fleeing Khartoum took refuge there, joining some 28,000 refugees from Ethiopia. At least 20,000 people have fled from Khartoum to the city of Wad Madani, 160 kilometers (100 miles) to the south, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Some 20,000 Sudanese have fled to Chad and around 4,000 South Sudanese refugees living in Sudan have returned home, according to the U.N. refugee agency, which is gearing up for tens of thousands more to flee to neighboring countries. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London, Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin, and Edith M.

       "full_text": "Country musician Morgan Wallen could find himself singing the blues. On Sunday, the \"Thought You Should Know\" singer suddenly canceled his performance minutes before he was set to perform at the Vaught-Hemingway Stadium in Oxford, Miss., due to losing his voice. The next day, one of the show's attendees sued him for breach of contract and negligence in a class-action lawsuit. The legal saga took another turn Tuesday, when the lawsuit was withdrawn in federal court, but attorney Casey Lott pledged to refile. \"The (first) lawsuit was mistakenly filed based on a misunderstanding. The lawsuit has been dismissed and the case is closed,\" Lott told the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal. \"We plan to refile the class action lawsuit with a new plaintiff in the coming days.\" Lott could not be reached by EW for immediate comment Tuesday. Representatives for Wallen noted to EW that the lawsuit had been dismissed. According to the initial complaint, the concertgoer alleged that Wallen had broken his own refund terms by canceling the event and that they were \"entitled to refunds of the out-of-pocket expenses they incurred in connection with the canceled performance.\" At Sunday's concert, a large screen announced that Wallen would not be performing and stated that refunds would be available at the point of purchase. However, the plaintiff claimed that all other related purchases should also be covered. \"Even if ticket prices are refunded, no offer has been made to reimburse concertgoers for other out-of-pocket expenses they incurred in connection with the concert cancellation,\" the suit read, \"including transportation, lodging, food, merchandise sales, transaction fees, and other such expenses.\" The complaint also alleged that Wallen had \"assumed a duty to exercise due and reasonable care for the financial property interests of his patrons\" who had spent money to attend the show, including \"ensuring foreseeable cancellations are announced in a timely manner in order to mitigate any damages incurred.\" As a result, the plaintiff was seeking \"money damages in an amount that will fairly and reasonably compensate them for the harm\" caused by Wallen, as well as additional relief for the \"mental anguish\" that they faced in consideration of Wallen's \"willful, reckless and intentional conduct\" at the show. On his Instagram Story on Sunday, Wallen explained that he started losing his voice after Saturday's performance and spent the following day \"resting up, talking to my doctor and working through my vocal exercises trying to get better.\" \"I really thought I'd be able to take the stage and it kills me to deliver this so close to showtime, but my voice is shot and I am unable to sing,\" he continued. \"All tickets will be refunded at point of purchase. I am so sorry, I promise you guys I tried everything I could.\" This isn't the only blunder that has befallen Wallen on tour over the last week. Last Thursday, the 29-year-old took a serious tumble on stage while performing his song \"Heartless\" in Kentucky.

       "full_text": " WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden on Tuesday formally announced that he is running for reelection in 2024, asking voters to give him more time to \u201cfinish this job\u201d and extend the run of America\u2019s oldest president for another four years. Biden, who would be 86 at the end of a second term, is betting his first-term legislative achievements and more than 50 years of experience in Washington will count for more than concerns over his age. He faces a smooth path to winning his party\u2019s nomination, with no serious Democratic challengers. But he\u2019s still set for a hard-fought struggle to retain the presidency in a bitterly divided nation. In his first public appearance Tuesday since the announcement, Biden offered a preview of how he plans to navigate the dual roles of president and presidential candidate, using a speech to building trades union members to highlight his accomplishments and undercut his GOP rivals, while showing voters he remained focused on his day job.  Greeted with chants of \u201cLet\u2019s Go Joe\u201d from a raucous crowd of building trades union members \u2014 a key base of Democratic support \u2014 Biden showcased the tens of thousands of construction jobs being created since he took office that are supported by legislation he signed into law. \u201cWe \u2014 you and I \u2014 together we\u2019re turning things around and we\u2019re doing it in a big way,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to finish the job. Finish the job.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign announcement, in a three-minute video, comes on the four-year anniversary of when he declared for the White House in 2019, promising to heal the \u201csoul of the nation\u201d amid the turbulent presidency of Donald Trump \u2014 a goal that has remained elusive.  \u201cI said we are in a battle for the soul of America, and we still are,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer.\u201d While the prospect of seeking reelection has been a given for most modern presidents, that\u2019s not always been the case for Biden. A notable swath of Democratic voters has indicated they would prefer he not run, in part because of his age. Biden has called those concerns \u201ctotally legitimate\u201d but he did not address the issue head-on in his launch video. Yet few things have unified Democratic voters like the prospect of Trump returning to power. And Biden\u2019s political standing within his party stabilized after Democrats notched a stronger-than-expected performance in last year\u2019s midterm elections. The president is set to run again on the same themes that buoyed his party last fall, particularly on preserving access to abortion. \u201cFreedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There\u2019s nothing more important. Nothing more sacred,\u201d Biden said in the launch video, depicting Republican extremists as trying to roll back access to abortion, cut Social Security, limit voting rights and ban books they disagree with. \u201cAround the country, MAGA extremists are lining up to take those bedrock freedoms away.\u201d As the contours of the campaign begin to take shape, Biden plans to run on his record. He spent his first two years as president combating the coronavirus pandemic and pushing through major bills such as the bipartisan infrastructure package and legislation to promote high-tech manufacturing and climate measures.  The president also has multiple policy goals and unmet promises from his first campaign that he\u2019s asking voters to give him another chance to fulfill. \u201cLet\u2019s finish this job. I know we can,\u201d Biden said in the video, repeating a mantra he said a dozen times during his State of the Union address in February. Vice President Kamala Harris, who was featured prominently alongside Biden in the video, held a political rally at Howard University in Washington on Tuesday evening in support of abortion access, kicking off her own efforts to support the reelection effort. Saying she\u2019s \u201cproud to run for reelection with President Joe Biden,\u201d Harris added, \u201cOur hard-won freedoms are under attack. And this is a moment for us to stand and fight.\u201d In the video, Biden speaks over brief clips and photographs of key moments in his presidency, snapshots of diverse Americans and flashes of outspoken Republican foes, including Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. He exhorts supporters that \u201cthis is our moment\u201d to \u201cdefend democracy. Stand up for our personal freedoms. Stand up for the right to vote and our civil rights.\u201d Biden also plans to point to his work over the past two years shoring up American alliances, leading a global coalition to support Ukraine\u2019s defenses against Russia\u2019s invasion and returning the U.S. to the Paris climate accord. But public support in the U.S. for Ukraine has softened in recent months, and some voters question the tens of billions of dollars in military and economic assistance flowing to Kyiv.  The president also faces lingering criticism over his administration\u2019s chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan after nearly 20 years of war, which undercut the image of competence he aimed to portray, and he\u2019s the target of GOP attacks over his immigration and economic policies. As a candidate in 2020, Biden pitched voters on his familiarity with the halls of power in Washington and his relationships around the world. But even back then, he was acutely aware of voters\u2019 concerns about his age.  \u201cLook, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,\u201d Biden said in March 2020, as he campaigned in Michigan with younger Democrats, including Harris, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. \u201cThere\u2019s an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.\u201d Three years later, the president now 80, Biden allies say his time in office has demonstrated that he saw himself as more of a transformational than a transitional leader. Still, many Democrats would prefer that Biden didn\u2019t run again. A recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows just 47% of Democrats say they want him to seek a second term, up from 37% in February. And Biden\u2019s verbal \u2014 and occasional physical \u2014 stumbles have become fodder for critics trying to cast him as unfit for office.  During a routine physical in February, Biden\u2019s physician, Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor, declared him \u201chealthy, vigorous\u201d and \u201cfit\u201d to handle his White House responsibilities. Hours after Biden\u2019s announcement, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre initially refused to say whether the president planned to serve all eight years if elected to a second term. She later clarified by tweet that \u201cI wanted to be sure that I didn\u2019t go into 2024 more than is appropriate under the law. But I can confirm that if re-elected, @POTUS would serve all 8 years.\u201d Aides acknowledge that while some in his party might prefer an alternative to Biden, there is anything but consensus within their diverse coalition on who that might be. And they insist that when Biden is compared with whomever the GOP nominates, Democrats and independents will rally around Biden. For now, the 76-year-old Trump is the favorite to emerge as the Republican nominee, creating the potential of a historic sequel to the bitterly fought 2020 campaign. But Trump faces significant hurdles of his own, including the designation of being the first former president to face criminal charges. The remaining GOP field is volatile, with DeSantis emerging as an early alternative to Trump. DeSantis\u2019 stature is also in question, however, amid questions about his readiness to campaign outside of his increasingly Republican-leaning state. To prevail again, Biden will need the alliance of young voters and Black voters \u2014 particularly women \u2014 along with blue-collar Midwesterners, moderates and disaffected Republicans who helped him win in 2020. He\u2019ll have to again carry the so-called \u201cblue wall\u201d in the Upper Midwest, while protecting his position in Georgia and Arizona, longtime GOP strongholds he narrowly won last time. Biden spoke Tuesday with Democratic governors about his reelection plans, while aides and allies briefed key political groups, grassroots organizers and state party officials on strategy, his campaign said. The president was set to huddle later this week in Washington with prominent party donors.  Biden\u2019s reelection bid comes as the nation weathers uncertain economic crosscurrents. Inflation is ticking down after hitting the highest rate in a generation, but unemployment is at a 50-year low, and the economy is showing signs of resilience despite Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. \u201cIf voters let Biden \u2018finish the job,\u2019 inflation will continue to skyrocket, crime rates will rise, more fentanyl will cross our open borders, children will continue to be left behind, and American families will be worse off,\u201d Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. Presidents typically try to delay their reelection announcements to maintain the advantages of incumbency and skate above the political fray for as long as possible while their rivals trade jabs. But the leg up offered by being in the White House can be rickety \u2014 three of the last seven presidents have lost reelection, most recently Trump in 2020. Biden\u2019s announcement is roughly consistent with the timeline followed by then-President Barack Obama, who waited until April 2011 to declare for a second term and didn\u2019t hold a reelection rally until May 2012. Trump launched his reelection bid on the day he was sworn in in 2017.  On Tuesday, Biden named White House adviser Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez to serve as campaign manager and Quentin Fulks, who ran Sen. Raphael Warnock\u2019s reelection campaign in Georgia last year, to serve as principal deputy campaign manager. The campaign co-chairs will be Reps. Lisa Blunt-Rochester, Jim Clyburn and Veronica Escobar; Sens. Chris Coons and Tammy Duckworth; entertainment mogul and Democratic mega-donor Jeffrey Katzenberg; and Whitmer.  \u2014 AP writer Chris Megerian contributed. ___ Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of President Joe Biden at https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden."

       "full_text": "The defense maintained the shooting suspect's innocence. A woman has admitted to dressing up as a clown and fatally shooting her husband's first wife at the victim's Florida home more than 30 years ago, though her attorney still maintains her innocence. Sheila Keen Warren, 59, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in a Palm Beach County court on Tuesday as part of a plea deal reached weeks before her trial was set to begin. She was arrested in 2017 for the murder of Marlene Warren, who was shot in the face after opening the front door of her home in Wellington in 1990 and died two days later. Keen Warren withdrew her plea of not guilty and changed her plea to guilty during Tuesday's court appearance. The plea deal calls for a 12-year sentence, though Keen Warren's attorney, Greg Rosenfeld, told reporters outside the courtroom that he expects her to be home in 10 months. If convicted, she faced a life sentence. Keen Warren, who has been in jail since her arrest, will receive 2,039 days of credit toward her sentence, Judge Scott Suskauer said while accepting the deal. Rosenfeld called the plea \"a big win for our client\" -- while continuing to deny her guilt in the shocking crime. \"It was an incredibly hard decision for our client, saying you did something that you didn't do,\" Rosenfeld said. \"I mean, nothing's harder than that.\" \"Our client wanted to go home,\" he added. During the hearing, prosecutors outlined evidence they would have brought forward during the trial that they say implicated Keen Warren in the fatal shooting on May 26, 1990 -- including testimony from witnesses from a local costume shop that placed her buying a clown costume and wig approximately two days before the incident. Palm Beach County Assistant State Attorney Reid Scott said that witnesses inside the home at the time of the shooting saw \"a clown come to the front door, hand Miss Warren balloons and flowers before shooting her in the face,\" then drive away in a white Chrysler LeBaron. A white Chrysler LeBaron was found approximately four days later in a Winn-Dixie parking lot that had \"trace evidence,\" including long brown human hairs and what law enforcement officers \"described as artificial orange-like fibers,\" Scott said. A search of Keen Warren's home at the time turned up similar fibers, he said. At the time of the murder, Keen Warren was a repossession agent who would repossess cars for the victim's husband, who operated a used car and rental business, prosecutors said. Keen Warren and the victim's husband, Michael Warren, would go on to own a restaurant in Tennessee and marry in 2002, prosecutors said. The two lived in Abingdon, Virginia, until Keen Warren's arrest in 2017. The facts of the case \"would lead a jury to find her guilty of the crime,\" Reid said. When asked by the judge if they were aware of any physical evidence that may exonerate the defendant, Keen Warren and her attorney both responded no. Warren's son, Joseph Ahrens, was at home at the time of the shooting, authorities said. He told Judge Suskauer he agreed with the terms of the plea deal. \"The only thing I want to say is, all through this trial, I didn't see any remorse,\" Ahrens told the court while appearing remotely. \"God be with her,\" he added. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Unit reopened the homicide investigation in 2014. After contacting witnesses and conducting additional DNA analysis, authorities said they established probable cause linking Keen Warren to the murder. A grand jury subsequently issued a true bill for first-degree murder a month before her arrest in September 2017. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Nearly 90 shell casings were found on the floor of the Dadeville, Alabama, dance studio where four people were killed and 32 others were injured this month, according to court testimony on Tuesday. In a bond hearing for the six defendants, Jess Thornton, a special agent with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, revealed new details about the April 15 shooting, which terrorized attendees of a Sweet 16 party and rattled the small Alabama community. A Tallapoosa County official, who was in the courtroom, confirmed to ABC News the contents of Thornton\u2019s testimony, which was recounted in local reports. Thornton said that roughly 50 to 60 people were inside the dance hall at the time of the shooting. At one point, he added, a DJ\u2019s speaker fell over, making a sound similar to a gunshot and prompting several of the partygoers to lift their shirts to show they had guns. An adult told the crowd that anyone over 18 or carrying a gun needed to leave. Soon after, shots rang out. Thornton described how at least two of the defendants were linked to the massacre. He said that one of the defendants, Willie Brown, denied being at the party, but shell casings from an unrelated incident, in which Brown was a suspect, matched a casing found in the dance hall. Another suspect, whom Thornton did not name, was wearing an ankle monitor from an unrelated shooting, whose GPS tracker showed he was in Dadeville. Meanwhile, a gun that was determined to have been fired was found on the chest of Corbin Holston, one of the victims, said Thornton. Following a bond hearing on Wednesday, a judge has ordered the six defendants in the shooting to be held without bail, Tallapoosa County District Attorney Michael Segrest tells ABC News. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

       "full_text": "Front page layout Site theme \nBenj Edwards\n    -  Apr 25, 2023 9:01 pm UTC\n On Tuesday, OpenAI announced new controls for ChatGPT users that allow them to turn off chat history, simultaneously opting out of providing that conversation history as data for training AI models. Also, users can now export chat history for local storage. The new controls, which rolled out to all ChatGPT users today, can be found in ChatGPT settings. Conversations that begin with the chat history disabled won't be used to train and improve the ChatGPT model, nor will they appear in the history sidebar. OpenAI will retain the conversations internally for 30 days and review them \"only when needed to monitor for abuse\" before permanently deleting them. However, users who wish to opt out of providing data to OpenAI for training will lose the conversation history feature. It's unclear why users cannot use conversation history while simultaneously opting out of model training. Previously, ChatGPT kept track of conversations and used the conversation data to fine-tune its AI models. Users could periodically clear their chat history on demand, but any conversation could still be used for fine-tuning. That posed a significant privacy issue, especially for sensitive data that might be shared by corporate employees, lawyers, or doctors using ChatGPT. ChatGPT's conversation history got OpenAI in hot water in March due to a bug that temporarily exposed some ChatGPT users' chat histories to other people. That event attracted regulatory interest in Italy that has not yet been resolved. The new privacy-related ChatGPT features are likely related to the resolution process. Also on Tuesday, OpenAI introduced a new \"export\" option in ChatGPT settings that allows users to export their ChatGPT data to files that can be stored locally on a PC. We tried the export option in ChatGPT Settings (click \"Show\" beside \"Data Controls\") and received an email with a link to a compressed HTML file and several JSON files that contained our stored conversation history with ChatGPT. The history only extended back to the last time we cleared the conversation history. For professionals and enterprises that \"need more control over their data,\" OpenAI also announced that it is working on a new \"ChatGPT Business\" subscription that will opt users out of model training by default, according to OpenAI's Data Controls FAQ. OpenAI says the release date for ChatGPT Business will occur \"in the coming months.\" Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox. \n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  \u00a9 2023 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Like McDonald's, Chipotle said traffic to its restaurants grew during the first quarter despite higher menu items. Chipotle's menu prices are up roughly 10% from a year earlier. CEO Brian Niccol said the chain has demonstrated that it has pricing power. \"We don't want to be in front of the inflationary environment, but we also don't want to fall behind,\" he said on the company's conference call. For now, Chipotle is pausing price increases, Niccol said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\" Shares of the company rose more than 7% in extended trading. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv: Chipotle reported first-quarter net income of $291.6 million, or $10.50 per share, up from $158.3 million, or $5.59 per share, a year earlier. The company's menu price hikes and lower avocado prices helped improve profit margins compared with the year-ago period. Revenue climbed 17.2%, to $2.37 billion, from $2 billion during the year-earlier period. Same-store sales rose 10.9%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 8.6%.\u00a0 Niccol said that higher-income consumers are returning to restaurants more frequently. Even lower-income diners are visiting more often than they were in the prior six months, although their traffic remains down from a year ago. Overall, traffic rose roughly 4% in the quarter, reversing last quarter's decline. In February, executives said January's same-store sales grew by double digits. A year earlier, the company saw sluggish sales as the omicron Covid outbreak put pressure on staffing and caused some temporary store closures. Chipotle's chicken al pastor is on track to be the chain's most popular limited-time protein option ever, Niccol said on the company's conference call. The company launched it in mid-March. Digital orders accounted for nearly 40% of sales during the quarter. Chipotle customers have been ordering their burritos and tacos more in person compared with the year-ago period. Executives also outlined changes coming to restaurants to improve speed of service and accuracy. The chain has been testing new grills that cook faster and more consistently. It has also been experimenting with how to staff its two make lines to keep up with demand from both in-person diners and digital orders. The company opened 41 new locations during the quarter, 34 of which included its drive-thru lanes reserved for digital order pickup.

The NFL Draft is just two days away, and nobody has any idea what's happening. The consensus is that Alabama's Bryce Young is going to be the first pick to the Carolina Panthers, but beyond that, it's all truly up in the air. Kentucky's Will Levis is having a last-minute surge on all the books. DraftKings said at around 9 a.m. Tuesday, he was +4000 to be the first pick of the Draft.

(Andy Lyons/Getty Images) One hour later, the book subtracted a zero from those odds, and he is now 4-1 to be the next Panther \u2013 Young remains the heavy favorite, with most books having him as at least a -1000 favorite. The dramatic shift in odds came amid a Reddit post from an anonymous user seemingly laying out the Panthers' plan to select him No. 1. \"Will Levis is currently +4000 to be the firs overall pick. Well ladies and gentleman, he\u2019s telling friends and family Carolina will in fact take him on Thursday. You\u2019re welcome,\" the Reddit user said. When asked who his source was, the anonymous poster responded, \"Will Levis.\" A DraftKings spokesperson told ESPN it was believed the shift in odds stemmed from the Reddit post. \"Given the nature of the draft, we drastically cut the price based on this action and eventually came to a price where the bets stopped,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are still seeing some small bets trickle through at the current price, but the speculation is all the action was off the back of a Reddit post.\" But Levis' burst has now put him as the odds-on favorite to be the second selection to the Houston Texans after that had long been Ohio State's C.J. Stroud. Action Network says that on April 17, Levis was +2000 to go second overall. One day later, he suddenly went to +180. He is now -140, via Odds Shark.

According to The Athletic, Stroud had the worst S2 score of any quarterback with an 18%. Young's 98% was the best. The S2 replaced the Wonderlic, and it \"measures the split-second processing of information and decision-making.\" In fact, it's not just Levis favored over Stroud to go second \u2013 some books have Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson and Texas A&M edge rusher Tyree Wilson with lower odds than Stroud to go to Houston, who also have the 12th pick via the Cleveland Browns from the Deshaun Watson trade.
