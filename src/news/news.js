  'full_text': 'The April 15 massacre killed four and injured 32 others. Nearly 90 shell casings were found on the floor of the Dadeville, Alabama, dance studio where four people were killed and 32 others were injured this month, according to court testimony on Tuesday. In a bond hearing for the six defendants, Jess Thornton, a special agent with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, revealed new details about the April 15 shooting, which terrorized attendees of a Sweet 16 party and rattled the small Alabama community. A Tallapoosa County official, who was in the courtroom, confirmed to ABC News the contents of Thornton’s testimony, which was recounted in local reports. Thornton said that roughly 50 to 60 people were inside the dance hall at the time of the shooting. At one point, he added, a DJ’s speaker fell over, making a sound similar to a gunshot and prompting several of the partygoers to lift their shirts to show they had guns. An adult told the crowd that anyone over 18 or carrying a gun needed to leave. Soon after, shots rang out. Thornton described how at least two of the defendants were linked to the massacre. He said that one of the defendants, Willie Brown, denied being at the party, but shell casings from an unrelated incident, in which Brown was a suspect, matched a casing found in the dance hall. Another suspect, whom Thornton did not name, was wearing an ankle monitor from an unrelated shooting, whose GPS tracker showed he was in Dadeville. Meanwhile, a gun that was determined to have been fired was found on the chest of Corbin Holston, one of the victims, said Thornton. Following a bond hearing on Wednesday, a judge has ordered the six defendants in the shooting to be held without bail, Tallapoosa County District Attorney Michael Segrest tells ABC News. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events',

    "summary": "Justice Samuel Alito believes he knows who leaked a draft opinion of the Supreme Court's ruling last year in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which largely tracked with the draft. In a recent interview, Alito suggested that someone who opposed reversing Roe v. Wade, which protects abortion rights nationwide, was responsible for the disclosure. Alito dismissed the idea that one of the five conservative justices leaked the draft and condemned the speculation as \"infuriating.\" The Supreme court's January statement called the disclosure a \"grave assault on the judicial process.\" Alito criticized those who have unfairly attacked the court and declined to comment on the scrutiny of Justice Clarence Thomas.",

The Detroit Lions landed Jahmyr Gibbs and Jack Campbell but failed to make a massive upgrade. The Los Angeles Chargers grabbed Quentin Johnston to address their need at wide receiver. Spite Stories missed out on potential situations involving Aaron Rodgers. The Philadelphia Eagles added Georgia players Jalen Carter and Nolan Smith to their defense, while the Miami Dolphins lost their first-round pick.

Republican legislators overrode Democratic Governor Laura Kelly's veto of the measure, which defines sex as an \"individual\u2019s biological sex, either male or female, at birth.\" The new law also legally defines women and men based on their biological reproductive systems and applies to school restrooms, locker rooms, prisons, domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers. Supporters argue that such legislation is needed to prevent transgender women from sharing facilities with cisgender women and girls, while opponents criticize the law for being too broad and difficult to enforce. Some LGBTQ activists argue that the measure could write transgender people out of state law. TL;DR: Kansas enacts one of the most sweeping and restrictive transgender bathroom bills in US history.",

The ruling bars voting rights groups from going to state court in the future to bring claims of extreme partisan gerrymandering against North Carolina maps. The decision also means Republicans can move forward with partisan gerrymandering and fortify their advantages in the US House of Representatives.",

The data suggests that Martian water played a major role in creating the dunes' intriguing surface features. The rover used a laser-induced breakdown spectrometer to analyse sand grains and found hydrated minerals that formed in the presence of water at low latitudes in the late Amazonian era on Mars, which scientists previously thought was bone-dry. The findings indicate that future missions to Mars could search for microbial life forms that might be able to tolerate salts or brines.",

Among the measures is the requirement to establish a three-day waiting period between purchasing and receiving a firearm, raising the legal buying age to 21, and expanding the state's red flag law. Republicans argue that these bills impede on Colorado residents' Second Amendment rights, with some predicting a backlash against the Democrats in the next elections.

    "summary": "The Indianapolis Colts have drafted quarterback Anthony Richardson with the fourth overall pick of the 2023 NFL Draft. Richardson, who has had only 13 college starts, is considered a high-risk, high-reward pick due to his all-world physical gifts and mechanical errors that negatively impacted his accuracy on the field. The Colts have Gardner Minshew II on the roster as a bridge QB, but there's little patience among fans, and it\u2019s hard to resist putting a physically gifted quarterback like Richardson in the lineup. The Colts are hoping quarterback Richardson will be their franchise-changing pick. In other news, teams have ignored criticisms aimed at positional value, with two teams drafting running backs in the first 12 picks. Jalen Carter, a Georgia defensive tackle, went to the Philadelphia Eagles with the No. 9 pick, while the Arizona Cardinals traded with the Houston Texans and got Paris Johnson Jr., an offensive lineman from Ohio State.",

  "summary": "Jerry Springer, talk show host and self-proclaimed ringmaster of his TV circus has died at the age of 79. His show featured guests that revealed cheating spouses, badasses, brawlers, and racists. With over 27 years on air, his show pioneered the use of rabble and mild violence in daytime TV. Springer's network relied on his show's entertainment value rather than shedding light on the human condition, with Springer cynically exploiting his guests for ratings. His gesture of sighing and lowering his head during brawls displayed his insincerity to the audience. Springer's legacy lived on, paving the way for shows that exploit TV viewers into video mayhem.

The Pentagon has sent unmanned ISR drones to fly over potential land routes, with US Naval assets on standby in case an evacuation is required. ",

   "summary": "China's Zhurong rover has found evidence suggesting that water may be more widespread and recent on Mars than previously thought. The rover detected salt-rich dunes mixed with melting morning frost or snow as recently as a few hundred thousand years ago, likely resulting in small cracks, hard crusty surfaces, and other dune features. Though the study authors believe the water might only be a small amount, it highlights new, potentially fertile areas where life could exist. The findings could provide insight into the possibility of water activity on the Red Planet and suggest that there may be a wider distribution of this process than previously identified. ",

The ensemble cast seems to radiate a sense of wanting to be someplace else, and this last gasp of Guardianship comes across as a loss of quality control from the studio. ",
